By decomposing the writing process into specialized agent roles, the system demonstrates how emergent behaviors can arise from structured agent interactions while maintaining coherence through typed constraints.\n\n## Agent Architecture\nThe system employs a hierarchical agent architecture based on three key theoretical principles:\n\n1. **Specialized Sub-agents**\n   - Each agent operates within a specifically defined domain\n   - Decision-making is constrained by explicit schemas\n   - Information flow is structured through typed interfaces\n\n2. **Hierarchical Coordination**\n   - Agents interact through a mediator-based architecture\n   - Higher-level agents provide strategic direction\n   - Lower-level agents handle tactical execution\n\n3. **Constrained Generation with Schema Validation**\n   - Output generation is bounded by formal specifications\n   - Cross-validation occurs at agent boundaries\n   - Schema enforcement ensures coherent composition\n\n## Sample Outputs\n[The Future of Work: Why AI Won't Replace Humans](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X_EPkniGo9QhxwZe_7DCVN0HtTCo-1jt-DxF6CbbNTc/edit)\n[Hierarchical Methods for Planning in Multi-Agent Systems: A Path Towards Efficiency and Cooperation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GU8IJFdHJlo1hvKS2BnW6IdbQhq03M3Ozct62fr4m38/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n\n## Environment Setup\n\nThis guide will help you set up the necessary environment and credentials for the Writing Agents project.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.7 or higher\n- A Google Cloud Platform account\n- An OpenAI API key\n- A Perplexity API key\n\n### Installation\n\n1. Clone this repository\n2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n writing-agents python=3.9\n   conda activate writing-agents\n   ```\n\n3. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n### API Keys Setup\n\n1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:\n   ```\n   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here\n   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_key_here\n   ```\n\n2. Google Cloud Setup:\n   - Create a new project in Google Cloud Console\n   - Enable the Google Docs API and Google Drive API\n   - Create a service account:\n     1. Go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts\n     2. Click \"Create Service Account\"\n     3. Give it a name and grant it the following roles:\n        - Google Docs API > Docs Editor\n        - Google Drive API > Drive Editor\n   - Create and download the service account key (JSON)\n   - Place the JSON key file in `./keys/NAME_OF_THE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT.json`\n\n## Usage\n\nSee `writing.ipynb` for usage.\n", "tree": "writing-agents_63150956-8852-4685-b4f2-c12382f510f8/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 __pycache__/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 create_doc.cpython-311.pyc\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 app.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 citations.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 create_doc.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 outputs/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 output.pdf\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 sample_outputs.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 writing.ipynb\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 writingagents.py\n"}
