Every paragraph should explicitly or implicitly support the thesis, creating a unified and focused narrative.\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. **Structure and Organization**:\n           - Begin the paper by clearly defining the thesis statement, ensuring it is specific, debatable, and sets the tone for the argument.\n           - The paper should include an outline with a compelling title and a sequence of well-structured paragraphs.\n           - Each paragraph must serve a distinct purpose, explicitly or implicitly supporting the thesis and connecting seamlessly to the next for a natural progression of ideas.\n\n        2. **For Each Paragraph**:\n           -

**Expository**: Explains key concepts, evidence, or background information essential for understanding the thesis.\n           - **Argumentative**: Advances a specific claim supported by evidence and analysis that directly supports the thesis.\n           - **Comparative**: Examines similarities or differences between two ideas, sources, or perspectives to highlight aspects that reinforce the thesis.\n           - **Synthesizing**: Connects multiple sources, arguments, or ideas to build a unified perspective and strengthen the thesis.\n           - **Counterargument**: Acknowledges opposing viewpoints, refutes them with reasoning and evidence, and reinforces the thesis.\n           - **Transitional**: Bridges ideas or sections to ensure a smooth flow and logical progression while maintaining focus on the thesis.\n           - **Analytical**: Delves into the implications, significance, or deeper meaning of evidence or a source in the context of the thesis.\n           - **Evaluative**: Critiques a source, argument, or perspective, assessing its credibility, strengths, and weaknesses in relation to the thesis.\n           - **Conclusion**: Summarizes the main arguments, reinforces the thesis, and provides a compelling closing statement or call to action.\n\n        4. **Writing Style**:\n           - Use a concise, persuasive tone that mirrors the style of a top-tier opinion piece.\n           -

Link implications to prior evidence and analysis and set up subsequent arguments.\n        - **Evaluative**: Critique a source or argument, focusing on its relevance and impact on the thesis. Ensure the critique builds on prior evidence and analysis and transitions to the next key point.\n        - **Conclusion**: Summarize key points, restate the thesis, and provide a strong closing insight or call to action. The final sentence should unify the discussion and leave a lasting impression.\n\n        3. **Writing Style**:\n\n        - Use clear, direct language that conveys meaningful content without unnecessary words. Don't use overly complex language.\n        - Avoid redundancy and focus on presenting new insights or advancing the argument.\n        - Maintain a logical flow that ties each paragraph to the thesis and ensures smooth progression between ideas and sections.\n        - Include in-text citations in APA format (Author, Year) when referencing sources or evidence.\n\n        4. **Paragraph Structure**:\n\n        - Begin with a topic sentence that establishes the paragraph's main idea and links it to the previous paragraph.\n        - Support the idea with concise evidence, analysis, or reasoning, including appropriate in-text citations for all evidence and claims from sources.\n        - End with a sentence that reinforces the thesis and transitions logically to the next section.\n\n        5. **Additional Guidance for Full Paper Structure**:\n\n        - Refer to the names and types of each paragraph to understand their individual roles and how they contribute to the overall argument.\n        - Ensure each paragraph builds on the ideas established in previous paragraphs and sets up the next for a cohesive narrative.\n        - Use transitional phrases and logical connections to maintain smooth and seamless progression.\n        - If you can reasonably assume that an abbreviation or idea has been defined in a previous paragraph or in the thesis, you should not redefine it and can use it as needed.\n        - Consistently cite sources using APA format in-text citations.\n\n        6. **Output**:\n\n        - Write a single paragraph of 150\u2013250 words unless specified otherwise.\n        - Ensure the paragraph is concise, precise, and ready to be part of the larger argument.\n        - Explicitly address the prompt, connect to the thesis in a meaningful way, and ensure smooth transitions from and to other paragraphs.\n        - Include appropriate in-text citations for all evidence and claims from sources.\n\n        \"\"\"\n\n        user_prompt = f\"\"\"Name: <n>{paragraph.name}</n>\n            Type: <type>{paragraph.paragraphType.value}</type>\n            Prompt: <prompt>{paragraph.prompt}</prompt>\n            Thesis: <thesis>{paper_structure.thesis}</thesis>\n            Paragraph Structure: <structure>{structure}</structure>\n            Research: <research>{research_responses}</research>\"\"\"\n\n        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(\n            model=self.model,\n            messages=[\n                {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt},\n                {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_prompt}\n            ]\n        )\n        return response.choices[0].message.content\n\n    def generate_paragraphs(\n        self, \n        paper_structure: PaperStructure, \n        research_responses: Dict[str, str],\n        progress_callback: Optional[Callable[[int, int], None]] = None\n    ) -> List[str]:\n        \"\"\"Generate paragraphs in parallel based on the paper structure and research.\"\"\"\n        structure = \"\".join([\n            f\"{i}. {paragraph.name} ({paragraph.paragraphType.value})\\n\" \n            for i, paragraph in enumerate(paper_structure.paragraphs)\n        ])\n\n        paragraphs = [\"\"] * len(paper_structure.paragraphs)  #
